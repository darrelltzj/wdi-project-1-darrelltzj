# Avoid the Raindrops
Avoid the Raindrops is a game developed at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) Course. In the game, each player controls a cat by maneuvering it along the screen's x-axis. Each cat has nine lives and loses one whenever it comes into contact with a rain droplet. The aim is for each player to last the longest. Avoid the Raindrops requires a keyboard and is best played on Chrome Version 56 or later.
