# Avoid the Raindrops
Avoid the Raindrops is a game developed at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) Course. In the game, each player controls a cat by maneuvering it along the screen's x-axis. Each cat has nine lives and loses one whenever it comes into contact with a rain droplet. The aim is for each player to last the longest. Avoid the Raindrops requires a keyboard and is best played on Chrome Version 56 or later.

## How to play
The instructions below explain how the game can be controlled and played.

### Key Control Summary
| Key           | Function      |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Escape        | Reload / Restart|
| Space         | Proceed / Pause |
| m             | Mute / Unmute   |
| Up Arrow      | Player 1 Select|
| Left Arrow    | Player 1 Left  |
| Down Arrow    | Player 1 Select|
| Right Arrow   | Player 1 Right |
| w             | Player 2 Select|
| a             | Player 2 Left  |
| s             | Player 2 Select|
| d             | Player 2 Right |

### Player Selection
The game starts off at the player control selection page and can be played with either one of between two players. Use the *Left* and *Right* arrows or the *a* and *d* keys to toggle between single and double players.

Players can use either the mouse or the keyboard to control their cats. Only one player can select the mouse. Users may use the *Up* and *Down* arrows and the *w* and *s* keys to select their preferred controls.

Once players are comfortable with their control selections, they may press *Space* to begin the game.

### Controlling the Cat
Keyboard Controls:
Player 1 uses the *Left* and *Right* arrows while player 2 uses the *a* and *d* keys to maneuver the cat left and right respectively.

Mouse Control:
If the mouse control was selected, shifting the cursor to either side of the cat would move it towards the respective directions. Placing the cursor within the cat's width would cause the cat to be stationary.
